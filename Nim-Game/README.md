# Nim-Game
The Nim-Game is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from distinct heaps or piles. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)

This Haskellversion is a specific variation of the Nim-Game!

How to play:

1: At the start you have to choose a number of sticks you will play with

2: Now both players have to remove 1,2 or 3 sticks after each other until there are no sticks left

3: The player who can take the last stick wins


Note:
- Player 1 will always start
- You can change the variable <numberPlayers> for more than two players
